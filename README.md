# Flower Classification

## Introduction
Welcome to the Flower Classification project! This repository contains the necessary resources and instructions to develop a robust flower classification model. The objective is to classify 104 types of flowers based on their images. The dataset comprises images drawn from five different public datasets, providing a diverse range of flower species and subtypes.

## Dataset
The dataset is available in TFRecord format, a popular container format used in TensorFlow for efficient data storage and processing. The dataset files are organized as follows:

- `train/*.tfrec`: Training samples with labels.
- `val/*.tfrec`: Pre-split training samples with labels for performance evaluation.
- `test/*.tfrec`: Test samples without labels for prediction.

## Model
In this project, we utilize the DenseNet model for flower classification. DenseNet is a convolutional neural network architecture known for its excellent performance in image classification tasks. By training the model on the labeled training set and optimizing its parameters, it can learn to identify distinctive features and patterns specific to each flower class.

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/shro-2002/flower-classification.git`.
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Load and preprocess the dataset using TensorFlow.
4. Build and train the DenseNet model using the training data.
5. Evaluate the model's performance using the validation set.
6. Make predictions on the test set.
7. Submit your predictions in the required format.

Feel free to explore the provided Jupyter Notebook and learn exercises for more detailed instructions on loading and using the TFRecord files and implementing the DenseNet model.

## Submission
To submit your predictions, follow the instructions provided in the `sample_submission.csv` file. Make sure to format your predictions correctly before submission.
